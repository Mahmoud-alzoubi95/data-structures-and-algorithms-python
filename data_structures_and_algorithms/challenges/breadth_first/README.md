# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.
Sort the data in breadth_first

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

Add a new method that called breadth_first

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- I used new approach that is how to extend your class with a new method

- Time complexity O(n^2)
