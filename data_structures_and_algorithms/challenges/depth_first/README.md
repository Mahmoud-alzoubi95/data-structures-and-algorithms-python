# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
<!-- Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection. -->

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

Add a new method that called breadth_first

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- I used new approach that is how to extend your class with a new method

- Time complexity O(n)
