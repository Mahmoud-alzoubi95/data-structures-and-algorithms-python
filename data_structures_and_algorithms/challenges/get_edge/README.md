Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
<!-- Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection. -->

Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

Add a new method that called breadth_first

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- I used new approach that is how to extend your class with a new method

- Time complexity O(n)
