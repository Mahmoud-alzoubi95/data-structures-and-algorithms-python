# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Stack applies the fundemental that is first in last out
Queue applies the fundemental  that is first in first out

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create node
create stack
create queue
create push, pop and peek methods for stack
create inqueue,dequeue,peek methods for queue

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Improve my algorithimity and take advantage of stack and queue which is used in beginning of micro-processors

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
stack:
push : store new data at top of stack
pop : fetch the top data and split it on the stack
peek : fetch the top data with out any changes happend to stack
is-empty: To check data existancy in the stack

Queue:

inqueue : store new data in front
dequeue : fetch the front data and split it on the stack
peek : fetch the front data with out any changes happend to stack
is-empty: To check data existancy in the stack
